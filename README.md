# First JavaScript Program: Calculator
## Challenges Faced:
1. Understanding Form Data: Grasping how to access and process form data submitted by the user was a new concept.
2. Error Handling: Implementing checks for non-numeric input and division by zero required learning new methods and understanding potential error scenarios.
3. Code Readability: Balancing functionality with clear and concise code structure was a challenge.

## Learning Outcomes:
1. Event Listeners: Learned how to use event listeners to capture user interactions with the form.
2. Form Data Processing: Understood how to access and manipulate data submitted through a form.
3. Error Checking: Gained experience in handling potential errors like non-numeric input and division by zero.
4. JavaScript Fundamentals: Solidified the understanding of basic JavaScript concepts like variables, operators, and conditional statements.

## Improvements:
1. Input Validation: The current code checks for non-numeric input after submission. Ideally, validation can be implemented before submission to provide a better user experience. This can be achieved using HTML input types or JavaScript validation libraries.
2. Error Messages: The error messages can be more specific. Instead of a generic "critical error," different messages can be displayed for non-numeric input and division by zero.
3. User Interface: The program currently focuses on functionality. A basic HTML form with labels and a styled output area can enhance the user experience.
