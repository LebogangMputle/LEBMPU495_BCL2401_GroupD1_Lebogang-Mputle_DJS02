# Vehicle Motion Calculations with Error Handling:
## Challenges Faced:

1. Error Identification: Identifying potential errors in the initial code, such as negative values for velocity, acceleration, or time, and incorrect unit usage (velocity in km/h, acceleration in m/s^2).
2. Implementing Error Handling: Implementing error checks and throwing informative error messages for invalid inputs.
3. Unit Conversion: Converting velocity from km/h to m/s before performing calculations involving acceleration (m/s^2) and time (seconds).

## Learned Outcomes:

1. Importance of Readable Code: Clear variable names, comments, and proper formatting enhance code maintainability and understanding.
2. Error Handling Techniques: Throwing errors for unexpected input helps prevent incorrect calculations and improves user experience.
3. Unit Consistency: Maintaining consistent units throughout calculations ensures accurate results.

## Future Challenges:

1. Expanding Calculations: Adding calculations for fuel consumption based on distance travelled and new features like fuel efficiency.
2. Input Validation: Implementing more robust input validation to check for data type and unit compatibility.
3. Unit Conversion Library: Exploring the use of a unit conversion library to handle various unit conversions.
